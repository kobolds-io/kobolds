# Migrating

Hi everyone, small reasoning document here. We are migrating `kobolds` to https://gitlab.com/kobolds-io. Please know that the goal of `kobolds` remains the same with no real alterations other than the hosting of sourcecode and general software development.

TLDR; My values do not align with GitHub's.

## Why?

Over the holidays I had a deep conversation with family and friends regarding the current political and economic status of our country (USA). Of course, these are fun topics to discuss with people with widely varying views of what they want from our leaders. Anyways, after 3 or 4 hours of conversation we all came to the conclusion that we all generally want the same things and that none of us are happy about what is happening to our country, let alone our planet.

GitHub has long been the defacto open source hub for most of the world's most popular projects. Although visionary for the time, its features are stale, buggy and generally poorly conceived. I share many of the complaints that the ZSF has with it as well, check out [Migrating from GitHub to Codeberg](https://ziglang.org/news/migrating-from-github-to-codeberg/). But most of all, GitHub is just another Microsoft company pushing shitty microsoft AI slop on its users. GitHub isn't as comprehensive as GitLab or the Atlassian suite. It isn't even good at CICD.

I encourage others to migrate to other alternatives instead of letting these shareholder run, profit driven, multi-billion dollar megacorporations siphon your intelligence off, repackage it into shitty AI slop, sell it back to you and call it groundbreaking innovation. The world runs off of thankless open source projects.

## When

**Effective 11/29/2025** I will be migrating all of the `kobolds-io` organization and all of its repositories to `https://gitlab.com/kobolds-io`. All issues and open PRs will also be migrated.

## How

For now, this will be a small private organization until we have something worth open sourcing. Remember, the goal is to create a fully FROM SCRATCH open source distributed message broker, and it remains the goal.

Git history will be updated to reflect updated usernames.

Thanks, Ben
